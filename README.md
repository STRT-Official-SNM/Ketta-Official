# Ketta ..Yet another virtual assistant

Dear devlopers, 
              <p>This is a public stable release of this assistant, so you may face some bugs or problems.</p>
              
# Installation
(Will be updated shortly)

# Quickstart

`git clone https://github.com/STRT-Official/Ketta-Official`

`cd Ketta-Official`

now, you have to run `vad.py` and `load.py` seperately
So :
`python vad.py`
`python load.py`

# What took so long?

We have been working on this for a while now. The main difference between the previous versions and this version is that this version has much faster keyword recognition thanks to developers for using Tensorflow instead of running selenium for using teachablemachine's keyword recognition.
This version is not fully functional in aspects other than keyword recognition.

Disclaimer : There are situations when the vad.py file will not close when you press ctrl+c. In that case, please close that terminal 
and use a new one.

This is the official, though strtsnm has a own repo of this. Tested and stable releases will be uploaded here. For beta versions , please visit : https://github.com/STRTSNM/Ketta
