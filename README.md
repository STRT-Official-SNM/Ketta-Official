# Ketta ..Yet another virtual assistant

Dear devlopers, 
              <p>This is a public beta version of this assistant, so you may face some bugs or problems.</p>
              
# Installation

Important note!!! : This build only works on linux(preferably arch linux) but we will sonn port it to other OSes (windows is in progress, almost completed!!) as well. Also installing Ketta may take a while.

Requiremets : wget, unzip(this is mosly preinstalled in all linux) and docker(if you want to do speech syntheses)

Step 1: run the setup.py file to download the required models.
Step 2(The last one..) : run the vad.py file to start the assistant.


Disclaimer : There are situations when the vad.py file will not close when you press ctrl+c. In that case, please close that terminal 
and use a new one.

This is the official, though strtsnm has a own repo of this. Tested and stable releases will be uploaded here. For beta versions , please visit : https://github.com/STRTSNM/Ketta
